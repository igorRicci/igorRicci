### Hi there üëã
My name is √çgor and I live in Brazil. I've graduated from Le Wagon's web development batch #898 in S√£o Paulo.

Here are some of the projects I'm working on:

- [CadeOTio](http://www.cadeotio.com.br/)
    - CadeOTio is a **mobile-app** still under development by my teammates and I that allow school drivers to show in real-time their geolocation. 
    - You can find the [code here](https://github.com/bdellacoletta/cade-o-tio)
- [MarketPlace](https://setimo-andar-matheusfortini7.herokuapp.com/)
    - SetimoAnder is a web app where you can buy and sell real estate.
    - You can find the [code here](https://github.com/matheusfortini7/setimo_andar)
- [Watch List](https://rails-watch-list-ricci.herokuapp.com)
