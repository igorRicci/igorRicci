### Hi there 👋
My name is Ígor and I live in Brazil. I've graduated from Le Wagon's web development batch #898 in São Paulo.

Here are some of the projects I'm working on:

- [CadeOTio](http://www.cadeotio.com.br/)
    - CadeOTio is a **mobile-app** still under development by my teammates and I. 
    - You can find the [code here](https://github.com/bdellacoletta/cade-o-tio)
- [Watch List](https://rails-watch-list-ricci.herokuapp.com)
